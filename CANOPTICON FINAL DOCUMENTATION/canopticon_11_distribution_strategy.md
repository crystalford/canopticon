# THE CANOPTICON FLOW (AUTHORITATIVE VERSION)

## CONCEPT
                   X / TikTok / Shorts
                 (hooks, fragments, signal)

                     YouTube (context)
                 (walkthroughs, synthesis)

                           ▼
        Substack (dispatches / excerpts / framing)
                           │
                           ▼

        CANOPTICON.COM (source of truth)
        Full investigations + archives

## WHAT THIS FIXES IMMEDIATELY
• You stop deciding “where something goes” every time
• You stop rewriting the same thing five times
• You stop feeling like Substack is competing with your site
• You stop leaking authority to platforms you do not own

Everything now flows in one direction.

## PLATFORM ROLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. Canopticon.com
**Role:** Canonical source
**Contains:**
– Full investigations
– Primary documents
– Long-form analysis
– Permanent archive

**Rule:** Nothing of consequence originates anywhere else. If it matters, it lives here first.

### 2. Email List
**Role:** Spine of the operation
**Contains:**
– Alerts
– Context
– Links to new investigations

**Rule:** Every major publication triggers an email. Email always points to the website, not Substack. This is your real audience.

### 3. Substack
**Role:** Distribution + trust builder
**Contains:**
– Excerpts
– Serialized framing
– Editorial voice
– Occasionally full pieces, delayed

**Rule:** Substack never becomes the archive. Each post explicitly signals: “Full investigation on Canopticon.” Substack is a window, not a house.

### 4. YouTube
**Role:** Sense-making
**Contains:**
– Walkthroughs of reports
– “Here’s what this actually means”
– Narrative explanation

**Rule:** YouTube explains what already exists. Never breaks primary stories.

### 5. TikTok / Shorts
**Role:** Signal amplification
**Contains:**
– One insight
– One hook
– One disturbing fact

**Rule:** No nuance. No completeness. Everything points inward. Views here are raw gravity, not depth.

### 6. X
**Role:** Real-time framing and provocation
**Contains:**
– Angles
– Questions
– Document screenshots
– Narrative pressure

**Rule:** X creates attention, not understanding.

## IMPLEMENTATION: CONTENT DERIVATION

You should not be “posting everywhere.”
You should be deriving downward from one core artifact.

**Automation by structure:**
One investigation becomes:
– 1 website piece
– 1 email
– 1 Substack framing post
– 1 YouTube explanation
– 3 to 5 Shorts
– 10 X posts
